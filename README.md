Your job/ goal as the player is to keep your group alive with the fewest fatalities as possible without getting infected yourself. You will form bonds with the members of your group and have all the more reason to save them and yourself. 

What the goal is: Get to the rumored safe town where they’ve discovered a cure with as close to a full party as you can. Keep as many people alive as you can.

How the game ends: The game will have ~2 endings where you make it to the town or you go insane from the grief and guilt of losing your friends and teammates along the way.
